### Overview

1. This project creates a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information using Moment.js.  This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

2. The game was designed for mobile first, and then upscaled to a desktop size using media queries in CSS. The images used for the theme were found using Google search for images.

3. App specs include: 

  * When adding trains, administrators will be able to submit the following information:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * This app is coded to calculate when the next train will arrive; relative to the current time.
  
  * Users from many different machines will be able to view same train times.
